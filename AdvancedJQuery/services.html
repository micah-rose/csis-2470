      <h3>Residential and Commercial Saging</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Saging involves cleansing, clearing, and protecting our home or
          business. Saging is also known as smudging. Its roots are in Native
          American cultures and traditions. It is a ritualistic way to cleanse a
          person, place, or an object of negative energies or influences. Many
          clients will request to sage their establishment before moving in or
          opening for business.
        </p>

      <h3>Spirit Interactions</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Anyone with an open heart and a willing soul, can sit with a spirit
          and begin to communicate. Spirits communicate through the psychic
          senses - and if you're a highly sensitive person (meaning you're
          emotional and a deep feeler) - it's likely you have at least a few of
          them. It's important that you are centered in your seat of self in
          order to have an effective, safe, and positive experience.

      <h3>Exorcisms</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Exorcism is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or
          other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, that are believed
          to be possessed. Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist,
          this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an
          elaborate ritual, or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of
          a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system
          of many cultures and religions.

      <h3>Paranormal Mysteries and Unsolved Cases</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Proposals regarding the paranormal are different from scientific
          hypotheses or speculations extrapolated from scientific evidence
          because scientific ideas are grounded in empirical observations and
          experimental data gained through the scientific method. Throughout
          history there have been cases of unsolved (or unexplainable) murders
          that our methods have been able to help comprehend and bring
          understanding to the incident.
